# Terminal Portfolio – Jeremy Jones

A terminal-inspired interactive portfolio that reflects both my technical capabilities and creative instincts. It pays homage to retro computing aesthetics and experimental web experiences (inspired by projects like Massive Attack’s digital art sites). Visitors interact with a simulated terminal environment to learn who I am, what I’ve built, and how I think.
